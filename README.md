> (WIP) Make javascript assignments reactive via a compiler

> DISCLAIMER: This project is still in development! It is not yet ready for use.

## Installation

_Not on npm yet._ See the [development](#development) section for instructions on how to get this project running on your own machine.

## Strategy

Modern javascript frameworks have become quite good at making javascript reactive. [React](https://reactjs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) are all reactive. The problem is that they are all linked to the browser. They all have some sort of templating engine, and thus can sometimes be a bit large and slow. The idea of this library is to just make plain javascript reactive. Implementations can come later.

The plan is that normoral javascript gets executed normorally, but when the compiler comes across this:

```js
$: foo = bar;
```

The value of `bar` will always be bound to `foo`.

The following is the plan to accomplish this.

> Note: To really understand the following examples, you need to be familiar with [reactivejs stores](#stores-api).

Via the compiler, this code...

```js
let foo = `bar`;
```

...gets compiled into this:

```js
import $$store from 'reactivejs';

let foo = `bar`;
let $foo = $$store.writableStore(foo);
$foo.subscribe(v => (foo = v));
```

And this...

```js
foo = `baz`;
```

...gets compiled into this:

```js
$foo.set(`baz`);
```

Therefore, this...

```js
// Assuming bin has already been declared
$: bin = foo;
```

...can be compiled into this...

```js
$$store.updatable(() => bin.set(foo), foo, $foo);
```

...and make `bin` reactive.

Written code:

```js
let foo = `bar`;
let bin;

$: bin = foo;

foo = `baz`;
```

Compiled code:

```js
import $$store from 'reactivejs';

let foo = `bar`;
let $foo = $$store.writableStore(foo);
$foo.subscribe(v => (foo = v));

let bin;
let $bin = $$store.writableStore(bin);
$bin.subscribe(v => (bin = v));

$$store.updatable(() => bin.set(foo), foo, $foo);

$foo.set(`baz`);

// bin now equals 'baz' because the $$store.updatable function
// calls the first paramater everytime one of the subsequent paramaters
// emits an update.
```

## Development

Pull Requests are encouraged and always welcome!

```sh
# fork repo
git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/reactivejs
cd reactivejs
npm i
npm test # or npm test -- -w
```

The code can be built via the `npm run build` command. To watch the filesystem and rebuild on changes, use `npm run build -- -w`.

The runtime library is located in the `src/runtime` folder. The compiler is in the `src/compiler` folder.

This project uses prettier for code formatting. Don't forget to run `yarn lint` before you commit.

## Stores API

### writableStore

```ts
store = writable(value: any);
```

`store` is an object with four methods:

-   `set(value: any) => void` - Sets the store to a new value
-   `get() => any` - Returns the store's current value
-   `update(fn: (currentValue: any) => any) => void` - Will set the value of the store to whatever is returned from `fn`
-   `subscribe(fn: (value: any) => void) => () => void` - Calls `fn` everytime the value of the store changes. Returns a function that will unsubscribe (stop calling `fn` when the value changes) when called

### readableStore

```ts
store = readableStore(startValue: any, actions: ({ set, update }) => void);
```

`store` is an object with all the properties as `writable` gives it, except `set` and `update`.

`actions` is a function that is passed in one property, an object containing the missing properties from `store`.

### updatable

```ts
updatable(fn: () => void, ...stores)
```

Calls `fn` everytime one of the store's value changes.

If a value is passed into `stores` that is not a store, ReactiveJS will silently ignore it.

### isStore

```ts
isStore(testValue: any): boolean
```

Just checks to see if `testValue` contains the appropriate `subscribe` and `get` methods.
